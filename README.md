# Task 14: Model Comparison & Best Model Selection

## Objective
Compare multiple ML models and select the best performing one.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- SVM

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

#### Final Outcome

- Trained and evaluated four machine learning models.
- Created a comparison table with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualized model performance using bar chart.
- Selected the best model based on test accuracy.
- Saved the best performing model for future use.

This task demonstrates practical model selection used in real-world machine learning projects.

## Tools
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
